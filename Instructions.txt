In the accompanying file (quiz.html), I have taken an HTML5 document previously without error and introduced a total of 10 BLANKS.  Please repair the file by filling in those blanks.

You may use online resources as you like.  I ask only that you please refrain from visiting the original Atlantic article from whence this material is borrowed.

This is a quiz about PRACTICE, as much as it is about CONTENT: As such, I encourage you to use any resources at your disposal to check your work before handing it in.

Once you have fixed the file to your satisfaction, turn it in via Canvas.  You may have as much time as you require to complete the quiz.

If you have any questions, please ask.
